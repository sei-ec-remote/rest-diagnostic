# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
different ways you access and interact with network resources
```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
GET(index) /movies/
GET(show) /movies/:id
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
REST style is standardized, so your code will be easier for other people to understand and vice versa.
You don't want to use REST if your site need a custom solution that doesnt follow the REST code.
