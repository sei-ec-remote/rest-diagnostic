# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
So basically, a way to name your routes in a way that makes sense?
Got definition from google
```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
https://www.something.com/movies
https://www.something.com/movies/:id
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

```md
Helps keep things organized and easier for other to understand the paths.

You may not want to use this when needing a very specific path such as user id?
