# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```REST is a set of principles that describe how networked resources are accessed and manipulated
there are  7 routes that allow us basic operations for reading and manipulating a collection of data
```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
(/movies
/movies/:id
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

```md
It makes it easier to write program with other programmers
The usage of ubiquitous standards is another characteristic for ease of integration that has to do with REST over HTTP
