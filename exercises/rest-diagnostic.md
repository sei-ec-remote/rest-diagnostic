# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here 
A set of 7 principles/routes that describe how network resources are accessed and controlled. (Source. Intro to rest notes)-->
```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
<!-- your answer here
GET'/movies'
GET'/movies/:id'
PATCH'/movies/:id'
DELETE'/movies/:id' 
(source into to rest notes)-->
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

```md
<!-- your answer here 
Rest is great because it gives you a set template to style and name your routes in your API . It is also helpful when working with others easier to read. 

it's not ideal when working on a custom project.
